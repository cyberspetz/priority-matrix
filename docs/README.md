## Screenshot

The screenshot.png file will contain a screenshot of the Priority Matrix application once it's deployed or when Playwright is properly configured for local screenshots.

To take a screenshot locally:
1. Ensure the dev server is running (`npm run dev`)
2. Install Playwright browsers (`npx playwright install chromium`)
3. Run the screenshot script (`node screenshot.js`)

The application features:
- Modern Eisenhower Matrix layout
- Drag & drop functionality between quadrants
- Task creation, completion, and deletion
- Responsive glassmorphism design
- Clean, professional interface inspired by Appfluence
