# Codex Prompt Trail – Priority Matrix App

| # | Stage | Instructions | Context | Input Data | Output Indicator | Approx. Context Window |
|---|-------|--------------|---------|------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | Foundational Eisenhower Layout | Build the first screen so it shows four Eisenhower quadrants with sample tasks and simple styling. Keep the setup lightweight, stick to the app directory structure, and avoid wiring up real data or auth. | Kick-off (commit `b977a85`) when we translated the Todoist + Eisenhower idea into a visible interface. | Design notes describing the four-quadrant concept, desired color accents, and a short list of sample tasks for each quadrant. | The team immediately saw the matrix come to life, aligning on look and feel before any deeper investment. Excitement grew because the vision was tangible from day one. | ~35k tokens (~14% of a 250k window) |
| 2 | Supabase Integration & Schema | Connect to Supabase, define a task structure covering priorities, deadlines, status, and manual ordering, then surface the data instead of mocks. Don’t touch interaction design yet. | Data plumbing milestone (commit `6271c46`) focused on replacing placeholders with live records. | Product requirements outlining required task attributes, existing Supabase credentials, and a CRUD checklist. | Tasks shown in the UI became real, proving the app could scale with authentic data. Confidence increased across the team. | ~60k tokens (~24%) |
| 3 | Quadrant Guidance Dialogs | Add “learn more” buttons for each quadrant that open clear guidance. Ensure dialogs are accessible and close smoothly; skip fancy animations or new copy beyond essentials. | Education layer (`29e9d56`) that helped new users adopt the Eisenhower approach. | UX copy explaining “Do First”, “Schedule”, “Delegate”, and “Eliminate”, plus accessibility expectations. | Users received helpful nudges exactly when they needed them, making the interface self-explanatory and demo-friendly. | ~28k tokens (~11%) |
| 4 | Fluid Background Atmosphere | Introduce a subtle interactive fluid background that reacts to pointer movement but never blocks clicks or taps. Avoid performance tuning for now. | Visual delight sprint (`8b6cc7d`) to differentiate the experience. | Inspiration mood board with living gradients, user feedback requesting motion, and readability guardrails. | The app suddenly felt alive and memorable, turning demos into wow moments while keeping content legible. | ~75k tokens (~30%) |
| 5 | Dialog Reliability Fix | Resolve dialog close/focus issues; make ESC immediate and eliminate console warnings. Leave copy and styling untouched. | Stability sweep (`346b785`) polishing earlier work. | Bug reports from manual testing, QA notes on keyboard navigation, and customer-experience expectations. | Dialogs blended into everyday use without surprises, letting the team focus on new features instead of small errors. | ~22k tokens (~9%) |
| 6 | Reports Sidebar Expansion | Enrich the reports drawer with a thoughtful layout, mini-insights, and a satisfying open/close motion. Do not add new database queries. | Insight iteration (`6e1fc4c`) answering “How are we doing?” inside the product. | Product brief on key metrics, sidebar wireframes, and leadership feedback about quick storytelling. | Stakeholders could glance at progress without leaving the app, so adoption sessions gained clearer narratives. | ~48k tokens (~19%) |
| 7 | Sidebar Theme Refresh | Harmonize the sidebar’s grayscale palette, tidy typography, and icon sizing so it feels premium. Keep navigation behavior unchanged. | UI polish (`a84d233`) requested after design review. | Before/after mockups, feedback on inconsistent shadows, and tone guidelines for a calm workspace. | The sidebar now matched the brand and lost its rough edges, earning comments that it finally looked “finished.” | ~32k tokens (~13%) |
| 8 | Task Editing & Scheduling Expansion | Deliver a full-featured task editor, handle due dates gracefully, keep manual ordering, and clean up migrations. Negative prompt: do not alter the front page layout yet. | Major functionality upgrade (`642e634`) shifting the app from viewer to planner. | Feature spec covering editor fields, Todoist-style references, and prioritized schema changes. | People could adjust tasks in place and move daily workflows into the matrix, transforming it into a practical tool. | ~85k tokens (~34%) |
| 9 | Password Gate with Dev Shortcut | Add a lightweight password screen that remembers success, auto-bypassing in development. Skip server sessions; this is a front-door guard only. | Access control layer (`a07a723`) ahead of wider demos. | Security checklist from the GenAI team, login copy, and developer ergonomics requirements. | We demoed safely without slowing developers, satisfying security while keeping productivity high. | ~40k tokens (~16%) |
| 10 | Scheduling & Priority Revamp | Redesign cards around flag-based priorities, clarify schedule vs. deadline, slim UX for mobile, and upgrade the quick schedule menu. Negative prompt: keep existing Supabase fields and Playwright coverage intact. | Latest transformation (`9c28676` onward) aligning with Todoist-level ergonomics. | Comparative study between Todoist and Eisenhower workflows, pilot feedback, and a backlog of mobile pain points. | The app now feels fast and intentional on every screen size, with priority cues that guide users at a glance. | ~210k tokens (~84%) |
