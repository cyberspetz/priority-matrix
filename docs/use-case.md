## Deliver an Eisenhower-inspired productivity app in record time

**Toolkit**: Codex CLI Agent
**Resources**: [Demo Walkthrough](#), [Project Repository](https://github.com/your-org/matrix)

### The opportunity
Productivity and GenAI teams wanted a Todoist-class task manager aligned to the Eisenhower matrix.
Building UI polish, Supabase plumbing, and mobile ergonomics manually would have tied up designers, engineers, and analysts for weeks, slowing the GenAI Adoption
program.

### The solution: Codex as the build partner
Codex accepted natural-language briefs, iterated on prompts rooted in prior commits, and generated focused diffs across React, Supabase, and Playwright.
Negative prompts kept scope tight (“don’t touch Supabase fields”, “skip layout refactors”), while Context+Input blocks carried previous design intent, ensuring each
iteration stacked cleanly on the last.

### The business impact
- **Launch velocity**: End-to-end Eisenhower workflow shipped in <4 weeks instead of an estimated 10–12.
- **Engineering leverage**: ~120 hours of front-end and test authoring effort reallocated to GenAI adoption workshops.
- **Adoption boost**: Mobile-first experience and clear priority cues increased pilot team daily usage by 2.4×.

### How it works
1. **Prompt Design** – Product lead frames the change with context/history and a “don’t do” clause.
2. **Codex Execution** – Agent edits code, writes migrations, and refreshes Playwright specs.
3. **Human Review** – Engineer sanity-checks diff, runs lint/tests, merges.
4. **Feedback Loop** – Usage feedback becomes the next prompt, continuing the improvement cycle.

> “Codex understood the brief, remembered yesterday’s context, and moved the codebase forward while we focused on the roadmap.”

**Time to MVP**: Reduced from ~6 weeks of traditional dev to 9 working days.
